# @web-widget/context

This is the package used internally by `@web-widget/web-router` and `@web-widget/web-widget` to manage async context.

Normally you should not use this package directly as it is provided in [@web-widget/helpers/context](https://github.com/web-widget/web-widget/tree/main/docs/helpers/context.md).
