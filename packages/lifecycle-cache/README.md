# @web-widget/lifecycle-cache

This is a simple and powerful end-to-end caching library.

The cache's lifetime begins when the server receives the request, and it will be serialized and streamed to the client until the client unloads The web page is cleared.

Normally you should not use this package directly as it is provided in [@web-widget/helpers/cache](https://github.com/web-widget/web-widget/blob/main/packages/helpers/docs/lifecycle-cache.md).
